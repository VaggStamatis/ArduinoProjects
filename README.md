# Arduino Projects 
This repository contains some Basic arduino projects and much more.
In each folder of the repository you can find a simple way to control 
a sensor (e.g a Servo, a TMP36, a HEX display and much more) and some
other creative ideas on how to use such a sensor.

## Microcontroller used
| Arduino UNO R3 | ESP32 DEVKITC U4 |
| -------------- | ---------------- |

## Project Contents
- **SENSORS**
    - Leds
    - TMP36 (LM35DZ)
    - 9G Servo motor 
    - Hex Display (1 digital Cube)
    - HEx Display (4 digital Cube _coming soon_ )
- **USEFUL PROJECTS**
    - Wifi Client (made for ESP32 board)
    - Node MCU (ESP32 controlled via Blynk device)
    - LCD control 
        - Project that takes input from Serial input and depicts it on screen
    - I2C LCD control (Arduino board _coming soon_)


## Clone this repository
You can clone this repository using the command 
```sh 
git clone https://github.com/VaggStamatis/ArduinoProjects.git
```

## Run each project
All the projects are tested live using an Arduino Uno or an ESP32 when needed. 
If there is a sensor or something in general that needs wiring in the project 
you can probably find a **.png** file in the folder that will help you with the wiring. 
Also you can use _TINKERCAD_ on your browser if you dont have the parts necessary for a project.
